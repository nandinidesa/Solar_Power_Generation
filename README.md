# Solar Power Generation

This project is a data analysis and prediction project that aims to explore the solar power generation dataset and extract insights from it. The project also includes a machine learning model that predicts the DC power for the next few days based on the weather conditions.
It also sees if we,
Can we predict the power generation for next couple of days? - this allows for better grid management
Can we identify the need for panel cleaning/maintenance?
Can we identify faulty or suboptimally performing equipment?



## Project Overview

The project is available on GitHub in the repository nandinidesa/Solar_Power_Generation. The repository contains the following files:

-> Plant_1_Generation_Data.csv: This file contains the hourly power generation data for Plant 1.
-> Plant_1_Weather_Sensor_Data.csv: This file contains the hourly weather sensor data for Plant 1.
-> Plant_2_Generation_Data.csv: This file contains the hourly power generation data for Plant 2.
-> Plant_2_Weather_Sensor_Data.csv: This file contains the hourly weather sensor data for Plant 2.
-> Solar_Power_Prediction.ipynb: This file is a Jupyter notebook that contains the Python code for machine learning and prediction.
-> README.md: This file contains a brief overview of the project.

## Data Analysis

The Jupyter notebook Solar_Power_Generation.ipynb contains the Python code for data analysis and visualization. The notebook is divided into several sections that cover data cleaning, data exploration, and data visualization. Here is a brief overview of each section:

1. Data Cleaning: This section covers data cleaning and preparation, including removing duplicates, handling missing values, and merging the two datasets.
2. Data Exploration: This section covers data exploration and analysis, including calculating summary statistics, visualizing the distribution of power generation, and exploring the relationship between power generation and weather conditions.
3. Data Visualization: This section covers data visualization, including creating line charts, scatter plots, and heatmaps to visualize the data.

## Data Prediction

The Jupyter notebook 'Solar_Power_Prediction.ipynb' contains the Python code for machine learning and prediction. The notebook is divided into several sections that cover data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and prediction. Here is a brief overview of each section:

1. Data Preprocessing: This section covers data cleaning and preparation, including removing duplicates, handling missing values, and merging the two datasets.
2. Feature Engineering: This section covers feature engineering, including creating new features based on the weather conditions.
3. Model Training: This section covers model training, including training a machine learning model to predict the DC power for the next few days.
4. Prediction: This section covers prediction, including using the trained model to predict the DC power for the next few days based on the weather conditions.

## Conclusion

The Solar Power Generation and Prediction project is a great example of how data analysis and machine learning can be used to extract insights from a dataset and predict future values.
